  <h1 class="page-title">About Me</h1>
  <p>Howdy!  Thanks for checking out my blog!  I hope to record here my trials and tribulations along the long journey of learning known as life.  I’m hoping that occasionally some other people might find this useful.  More importantly, I’m hoping that I’ll find this to be useful!  At the very least, I’ll know where to look for annoying things that I figured out once and don’t want to figure out again!</p>

<p>As this is an ‘about me’ page I guess I should say something about me, err, myself.  First and foremost, I am a scientist - primarily of the physics variety but now transitioning over to data.  I believe that there are new and remarkable connections between these two disciplines which I hope to explore in the coming years.  This blog will be my journal while exploring these connections.  Enjoy!</p>

In the novel, *The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde*, Mr. Poole is Dr. Jekyll's virtuous and loyal butler. Similarly, Poole is an upstanding and effective butler that helps you build Jekyll themes. It's made by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo).

There are currently two themes built on Poole:

* [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com)
