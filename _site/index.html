        TravelApp II - Cold Start Problem

    <time datetime="2018-11-22T00:00:00-08:00" class="post-date">22 Nov 2018</time>

    <p>Today I’ll be continuing my discussion of the TravelApp recommender system. Recall that our goal is to take a bunch of user-generated attraction ratings and then use this to make predictions about which attractions a new user might like.  So, our input data looks like this:</p>

<table>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Golden Gate Bridge</th>
      <th>Alcatraz</th>
      <th> Gregangelo </th>
      <th> SF MoMA </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Alice</td>
      <td>5</td>
      <td>4</td>
      <td> <font color="red">?</font> </td>
      <td> 2 </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Bob</td>
      <td>4</td>
      <td><font color="red">?</font></td>
      <td> 0 </td>
      <td> <font color="red">?</font> </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Charlie</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>2</td>
      <td> 5</td>
      <td> 4</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td> Tom </td>
      <td> <font color="red">?</font> </td>
      <td> 2 </td>
      <td> 4 </td>
      <td> 5 </td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>…and our goal is to figure out where a first-time user of our app would like to visit.</p>

<p>Now, if our putative new user had <em>already</em> rated dozens of attractions then we could just build a collaborative auto-filter, as described in a previous post.  However, we are by assumption interested in a new user who is visiting a new city for the first time.  There probably won’t be much overlap between attractions visited by the individual and the ones in a given city.</p>

<p>So, what should we do?  Clearly, we need to have <em>some</em> data on this user in order to get started.  Without anything better, all we can do is ask the user how much they like certain qualities of travel attractions and then try to match them to attractions with similar qualities.  We will call these user-defined features <strong>preferences</strong>.  Since the user will be asked to rate their preference in several categories, we will speak of a <strong>preference vector</strong>.</p>

<p>Now, we also want the power of neural networks so that we can capture non-linearities and keep improving as our information on the user increases.  Thus, our solution is to append the <strong>preference (row) vector</strong> to the row-vector of ratings which we assign to each user.  Of course, for a new user, the ratings will be <code class="highlighter-rouge">NaN</code>, but then we are back in the situation where we can use the collaborative auto-filter again!</p>

<p>Pictorially, we have something like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1Pmve5AFc_deA79EF-sDPSzIA6fQXH07M" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Ok, so how do we get <strong>preference vectors</strong> to add to our user data to begin with?  Well, I apologize but we’re going to need to make some arbitrary, albeit reasonable, choices in order to move forward.  For the new user, the answer is simple - we make up some categories, “Nature, Culture, History and Recreation” to be specific, and then ask the user to rate themselves on a scale of -10 to 10.  The interface (at this very moment) looks like:</p>

<p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1Ys-UevLFgJukTGfmyn9i1gQjvvKFZ0nl" alt="image" /></p>

<p>So, this user loves Nature and is ambivalent about Culture, History and Recreation.  (He also wants to travel from 8am to 5pm and has $2000 to blow.)</p>

<p>Next, we need to generate some kind of comparable <strong>preference vector</strong> for the users in our database.  This is where it gets a little bit tricky.  A-priori, we don’t know how to correlate the self-rankings of a new user to the profiles we have in our database.  However, since we need to do something, here how we proceed.  First, we note that the travel sites sourcing our data provide tags to describe each site, i.e, things like “Hiking” or “Museum”.  We then map all of these tags (several hundred of them) to our categories.  For instance, a “Art Museum” gets translated to “Culture” and “Hiking” gets translated to “Nature”.  Thus, an attraction that has the tags “Hiking and Art Museum” will be assigned a preference vector (1,0,1,0) in the (Nature,History,Culture,Recreation) basis. Sometimes it gets tricky.  For instance, a log cabin is purely history, but a history museum could be both “History” and “Culture”.  In any case, we will just sum up the various tags translated into our basis to get a feature vector for a site.  For an individual use, we then take a linear combination of all the places they’ve visited, weighted by the scores they’ve assigned each attraction.  In pictures, we have:</p>

<p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1-t-w-wAOJ5Qh-QHdNdxzOqSc4L2sMo91" alt="image" /></p>

<p>As a final step, we convert all of these numbers to percentiles and then scale the result to the range 0 to 10.  Converting to percentiles makes the data much more smooth and so the neural network will train more quickly.  We map to the range 0 to 10 (and not -10 to 10 as with our new-user inputs) because people just don’t go to places they don’t like.  In other words, even if someone tends to rank Nature places lowly, the fact that they went at all means they don’t “hate” nature too much.  On the other hand, some people do truly hate the outdoors and would have never gone in the first place.  Thus, our sliders have an additional range of values that account for people who aren’t represented in the dataset because they never visited a certain kind of attraction in the first place.</p>

<p>One may questions all these assumptions, but, at the very least, we are able to generate a recommender system that is very sensitive to the users input.  I.e., changing the input will change the recommendations in a ‘reasonable’ way.  Let’s see what the output is for the settings above:</p>

<p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=17f8rjfg93G0B62Efe6iqTiSH3w9O1QGZ" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Not so bad, we do indeed get a lot of Nature-heavy recommendations as expected.  The next step is to use these to build an actual itinerary, to be discussed later!</p>

      <a href="/2018/11/21/GCloud+Tensorboard/">
        Google CLoud Computing with Tensorboard
      </a>
    </h1>

    <time datetime="2018-11-21T00:00:00-08:00" class="post-date">21 Nov 2018</time>

    <p>In today’s post I’m going to describe how to set up Tensorboard on google cloud so that you can monitor your deep learning progress with ease.  For the neophytes reading this, Tensorboard is an application that comes with Tensorflow and it allows you to visualize key metrics that are logged while the training is in progress.  The result is served on port 6006 of the ‘local’ browser and looks something like the picture below.</p>

<p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1gPpKJsJA93PPs-etLmTmhoTo1UyZTSy6" alt="Hope this works!" /></p>

<p>In this example, the cross-entropy is displayed.  We can, however, collect and display any statistic from the learning process we want, as well as the graph of the network.</p>

<p>This is all well and good, but there are a couple of challenges to be met in going from the ‘vanilla’ instructions on the website to what I actually wanted to do.  First off, I wanted to run the training on google cloud so that my model is working even while my computer (and me) are sleeping.  Second, I’m not using Tensorflow directly, I’m using Pytorch and Tensorflow is merely serving as a backend.  Thus, some of the instructions for setting things up need to be adjusted.</p>

<p>For the second problem, Pytorch vs Tensorflow, there is an off the shelf solution: <a href="https://pypi.org/project/tensorboardX/">TensorboardX</a> or <a href="https://github.com/lanpa/tensorboardX"> here</a> for the source.  This very straight-forward to get the hang of.  Here I’ll just give a very simple example of the basic usage.  The procedure is as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">pip</code> install TensorboardX.</li>
  <li>In your (Python) header include <code class="highlighter-rouge">form tensorboardX import SummaryWriter</code></li>
  <li>Before your training loop, declare a summary writer via:
 <code class="highlighter-rouge">writer=SummaryWriter()</code></li>
  <li>For any variable, <code class="highlighter-rouge">v</code> which you’d like to log during training, include:<br />
<code class="highlighter-rouge">writer.add_scalar('logfile',v,i)</code>, where ‘logfile’ is the path to the log file that you want to put this information in.  (No harm in literally just using ‘logfile’!) and ‘i’ is the iteration that we are on in the training run.  So, you can think of <code class="highlighter-rouge">i</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">v</code> as being like the <code class="highlighter-rouge">x</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">y</code> coordinates of a scatter plot that we are going to make.</li>
  <li>It’s good practice to close the writer after the training loop: <code class="highlighter-rouge">writer.close()</code></li>
  <li>Now, start training!  We will immediately start generating data that gets dumped to the logfile.</li>
  <li>Now, in the terminal, type:
<code class="highlighter-rouge">tensorboard --logdir path</code>, where path leads to the directory where <code class="highlighter-rouge">logfile</code> lives.</li>
  <li>Great, we have launched the tensorboard!  Where does it live?  Well, this is essentially a web app, so it lives in your browser.  By default the images are served to port 6006.  So, in the browser, just go to <code class="highlighter-rouge">localhost:6006</code> and see!</li>
</ol>

<p>So far so good - this is a standard Tensorboard workflow.  However, it is a little more tricky when we want to do the training on a cloud platform like Google Cloud.  There, we can indeed follow all of these steps, but the result will just be displayed for a browser listening to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">localhost</code> in Google’s compute center!  How do we get access to this?</p>

<p>A similar problem already occurs if we want to have <em>any</em> interactive GUI environment while working on the cloud.  Sure, we can easily run scripts on the cloud, but how do we see what is going on?  The answer: <strong>port mapping</strong>.  We need to map the output of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">localhost</code> on Google’s machine to the local host on our machine.  Assuming we already have the google compute instance set up and running and the gcloud cli installed, the magic incantation to do port mapping is:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">gcloud</span> <span class="n">compute</span> <span class="n">ssh</span> <span class="n">instance_name</span> \
  <span class="o">--</span><span class="n">project</span> <span class="n">project_id</span> \
  <span class="o">--</span><span class="n">zone</span> <span class="n">zone_name</span> \
  <span class="o">--</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">NL</span> <span class="mi">4321</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="n">localhost</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="mi">6006</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>(See <a href="https://cloud.google.com/solutions/connecting-securely">here</a> for more details.) After running this, we can now just go to our browser and enter the url: <code class="highlighter-rouge">localhost:4321</code> viola! Tensorboard let’s the tensors flow straight to us!  Here is a actual screenshot from my first two (not very succesful) runs. (Note that we need to change the name of the logfile between runs in order to save more than one run):</p>

<p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1LQ_rl7UTwyVE91XXStlH9Obl-Tsp1GgT" alt="tb2" /></p>

<p>Again, the port mapping technique is not specific to Tensorboard and is useful for any GUI we want to use on the cloud.  For instance, suppose we are running <a href="http://zeppelin.apache.org/">Zeppelin</a> (highly recommended) on google cloud.  The canonical port is <code class="highlighter-rouge">8080</code>, so we just need to run:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">gcloud</span> <span class="n">compute</span> <span class="n">ssh</span> <span class="n">instance_name</span> \
  <span class="o">--</span><span class="n">project</span> <span class="n">project_id</span> \
  <span class="o">--</span><span class="n">zone</span> <span class="n">zone_name</span> \
  <span class="o">--</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">NL</span> <span class="mi">1111</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="n">localhost</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="mi">6060</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Of course, we also need to pick an unoccupied port for our local browser!</p>

<p>Now we are all set!  You can run a massive training run on the cloud all week, check in on it’s progress, and not worry about having to babysit your computer :) Hope this was informative.  Now, I’m going to get back to trying to figure out why my training curves are so flat!</p>
