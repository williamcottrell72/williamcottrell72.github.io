## Domain

I will be attemptig to calssify Kickstarter projects as successful or failed based on other features of the project.  I have visited the Kickstarter website and am relatively familiar it.  More generally, this project could be viewed as a baby step towards understanding when a business/project is likely to be succesful.

## Data

The data I have so far was found on Kaggle.  I also plan to look into other data sources. The dataset of (completed) projects consists of ~45K rows with the following variables

|Variable |Type|
|---|---|
|Project Id   | Int  |
| Name   | String  |
|url   | String  |
|Category   | String  |
|Subcategory   | String  |
|Location   |String   |
|Status   | String  |
|Goal   | Float  |
|Pledged   | Float  |
|Funded Percentage   | Float  |
|Backers | Int|
|Funded Date  | datetime  |
|Levels   | Int  |
|Reward Levels   |String   |
|Updates   | Int  |
|Comments   |Int   |
|Duration   | Int  |


## Known Unknowns

Many important aspects of the project are not available from the dataset.  These include

1.) Competence / knowledge of project organizers.
2.) External advertising budget.

There is also data that is available but may be difficult to utilize.  For example, the kickstarter website has verbal descriptions of the data, but profiting from this will require a substantial amount of NLP.  In principle, I could try to utilize this.
